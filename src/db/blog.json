    "description": "The Cloud Nine beach surprised with its size and emptiness. This is approximately 3 kilometers of a wide beach sand strip and very few vacationers. Being there you understand how Boracay was 30 years ago. An excellent descent into the water, there is a separate bark reef to which it is easy to swim and it has something to see. That is, this is a rare combination of both fussing and snorkeling."
